# ES-Discuss

ES-Discuss is the mailing list where the future of JavaScript is discussed and agreed upon.  Unfortunately the threads are not nicely formatted or easy to read.  This project aims to group all the messages from each thread into one, nice, cleanly formatted markdown document.

Wherever possible I will aim to maintain the meaning of what was said, but I may change formatting, and remove duplicated content (such as quoting the entirety of the previous message).  If you feel one of the documents mis-represents what you originally said, submit a pull request to correct the statements.
